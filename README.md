# Overview
This repository includes projects for the final part of the course **Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving by University of Colorado Boulder**.

# Course description

This Specialization is for learners wishing to dramatically change the way that they use Excel spreadsheets by unleashing the power to 
automate and optimize spreadsheets using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The first two courses teach learners the basics of VBA 
through the use of dozens of educational screencasts and a series of quizzes and in-application programming assignments. Finally, in Part 3
of the course, learners complete 3 "real world" and somewhat open ended projects, which are graded through peer review.
